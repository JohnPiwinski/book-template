This project is forked from https://github.com/DGrady/book-template. The original README is as follows. 

A nice book template using LaTeX and the memoir document class

This is a template for a book-length work that uses LaTeX and the `memoir` document class. It's designed for printing on 6-by-9-inch paper (US Trade). The only particularly novel features that I can lay claim to are the chapter headers, which include a nice swelled rule, and the labels for figures, tables, and equations. The type block is four inches wide, and it's laid out asymmetrically so that there's a wide spine margin. This pushes the main text to the outside of the page, where there's less distortion when someone sits down to actually read a published version of your work. This means the spine margin is quite generous, and I use it for labels: table, figure, and equation labels are automatically pushed into the spine margin. A slick trick for LaTeX!

# Modifications #

I have replaced serif fonts with their sans counterparts. All non mathematical fonts are provided in the source code sans font.
